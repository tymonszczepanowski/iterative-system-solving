Implementation of Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterative system solving methods.

Convergence is only guaranteed if the matrix is either strictly diagonally dominant,or symmetric and positive definite. 
We assume that euclidian distance between Ax - b is less than 1e-9 is sufficient sufficient condition for convergence.
