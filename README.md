Implementation of Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterative system solving methods.

Convergence is only guaranteed if the matrix is either strictly diagonally dominant,or symmetric and positive definite. 
We assume that euclidean distance between Ax and b lesser than 1e-9 is sufficient condition for convergence.
